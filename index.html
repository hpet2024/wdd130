            <p>Hello! My name is Heather Peters and I am from Binghamton NY but I have lived many places since my father was in the military. I met my husband in the summer between sophomore and junior year in high school. We were married in July 1991 in Omaha Nebraska and sealed in the Washington DC Temple. I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho through BYU Pathway and I have learned so much so far and look forward to completing my degree in software development. I moved to Florida in December 2019 to be close to my maternal grandmother, I currently live in Casselberry Florida which is about 40 minutes north of Walt Disney World. My husband and I are ordinance workers in the Orlando Florida Temple every other Saturday and we team teach Come Follow Me in Sunday School to the 11-14 year old youth of our ward. In my free time I enjoy doing crafty things such as cross stitch and basket weaving.
